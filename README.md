# **🔹 Lesson 01**

### **Codility Training - Challenge #1**

---

### **Problem: Find the Missing Element**

You are given an **array A** consisting of **N different integers** ranging from **1** to **N+1**. This means that exactly **one number is missing** from the sequence. Your task is to find the missing number.

#### **Example**

```java
Input: A = [2, 3, 1, 5]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** The numbers from 1 to 5 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The missing number is **4**.

---

### **Function Signature**

```java
public int findMissingNumber(int[] A)
```

---

### **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq N \leq 100,000 \)
- \( 1 \leq A[i] \leq N+1 \) (each number appears once)

---

### **Requirements**

✅ **Time Complexity:** **O(N)**  
✅ **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (constant extra space)

---

### **Hint**

You can solve this problem efficiently using **Mathematical Sum Formula**:

\[
\text{Sum of first } N+1 \text{ numbers} = \frac{(N+1) \times (N+2)}{2}
\]

Then, compute the sum of elements in **A** and subtract it from the expected sum.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #2**

Let's move to a slightly more **complex problem** that involves **arrays and counting**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Find the Odd Occurrence**

You are given an **array A of N integers**. Every element appears an **even number of times**, except for **one element**, which appears **an odd number of times**.

✅ **Find the element that occurs an odd number of times.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]
Output: 7
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- `9` appears **4 times** (even count).
- `3` appears **2 times** (even count).
- `7` appears **1 time** (**odd count** ✅).
- **Return** `7` (the only number with an odd occurrence).

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int findOddOccurrence(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000` (up to 1 million elements)  
✅ Each number appears **even times, except one**  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (⚡ Efficient Solution Needed)  
✅ **O(1) extra space preferred** (No hash maps!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Can you solve it using a XOR operation?**  
2️⃣ XOR cancels out **even occurrences**:

```
A ⊕ A = 0
```

3️⃣ The remaining value will be the **odd occurrence number**.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #3**

Let's move on to a **slightly harder problem** that involves **prefix sums** and **array traversal**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Equilibrium Index**

You are given an **array A** consisting of **N integers**. An index **P** is called an **equilibrium index** if:

\[
\text{Sum of elements before P} = \text{Sum of elements after P}
\]

✅ **Find any one equilibrium index P or return -1 if none exists.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
At index `3` (`A[3] = 2`), we have:

- **Left sum** = `(-7 + 1 + 5) = -1`
- **Right sum** = `(-4 + 3 + 0) = -1`
- Since **left sum = right sum**, return `3`.

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int findEquilibriumIndex(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)  
✅ **Any valid index is acceptable** (If multiple, return **any one**).

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ Use **prefix sum** to efficiently compute left and right sums.  
2️⃣ **Total sum = Left sum + A[P] + Right sum**  
3️⃣ If `Left sum == Total sum - Left sum - A[P]`, then `P` is an equilibrium index.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #4**

Let's move on to a **more complex problem** involving **sorting and greedy algorithms**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Max Product of Three**

You are given an **array A** of **N integers**. Your task is to **find the highest possible product** of any **three numbers** from the array.

✅ **Return the maximum possible product of any three numbers.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [-10, -10, 5, 2]
Output: 500
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- The highest product is `(-10 * -10 * 5) = 500`, not `(5 * 2 * -10) = -100`.

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int maxProductOfThree(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `3 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `-1,000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000`  
✅ **O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N³) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Sorting helps!** After sorting, the largest product will be:

- Either **Top 3 biggest numbers**:  
  \[
  A[N-1] \times A[N-2] \times A[N-3]
  \]
- Or **Two smallest negative numbers + biggest positive number**:  
  \[
  A[0] \times A[1] \times A[N-1]
  \]

2️⃣ **Compare both possibilities and return the maximum product.**

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #5**

Let's move to a **different type of problem** involving **greedy algorithms and counting**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Tie-Rope Segments (Greedy Algorithm)**

You are given **an integer K** and an **array A** of **N integers**, representing **rope lengths**.

✅ **You need to count how many ropes of at least length `K` can be formed** by tying together adjacent ropes.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: K = 4, A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3]
Output: 3
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
We can form **3 ropes** that are at least length **4**:

1. Tie `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (Valid ✅)
2. Use `4` alone (Valid ✅)
3. Tie `1 + 1 + 3 = 5` (Valid ✅)

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int countRopes(int K, int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Use a greedy approach:**

- Keep summing adjacent rope lengths.
- If the sum reaches `K` or more, count it as a valid rope and start over.  
  2️⃣ **Only traverse the array once** (O(N) solution required).

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #6**

Let's move on to a **more complex problem** that involves **arrays and prefix sums**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Passing Cars (Prefix Sum)**

You are given an array **A** of **N integers**. The array represents cars on a road:

- `0` represents a **car traveling east**.
- `1` represents a **car traveling west**.

✅ **Count the number of passing car pairs (`0,1`) on the road.**

A passing car pair is when a car **traveling east (`0`)** passes a car **traveling west (`1`)**.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
Output: 5
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
The following **pairs** are valid:

- `(A[0] → A[1])`
- `(A[0] → A[3])`
- `(A[0] → A[4])`
- `(A[2] → A[3])`
- `(A[2] → A[4])`

✔ **Total passing cars = `5`** ✅

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int countPassingCars(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ Each element in `A` is either `0` or `1`.  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **A naive approach (O(N²)) is too slow**

- Iterating through each `0` and counting how many `1`s appear after it is inefficient.

2️⃣ **Use a prefix sum or a counter**

- Count **how many `0`s have appeared so far**.
- Every time you find a `1`, all previous `0`s contribute to passing car pairs.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #7**

Let's try a **harder problem** that involves **stack data structures**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Stone Wall (Stack)**

You are given an **array A of N integers**, where each element represents the **height of a wall at position i**.

✅ **Find the minimum number of blocks required to build the wall.**

Each block can be **of any height**, but it must be **rectangular** and extend **to the ground**.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [8, 8, 5, 7, 9, 8, 7, 4, 8]
Output: 7
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
We need **7 blocks** to build the wall:

- `8` (first block)
- `5` (second block starts after 8)
- `7` (third block starts after 5)
- `9` (fourth block starts after 7)
- `8` (fifth block starts after 9)
- `7` (sixth block starts after 8)
- `4` (seventh block starts after 7)

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int minBlocksToBuildWall(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Use a stack to track height changes**

- A **new block** is needed when `A[i] > stack.peek()`.
- **Pop elements** when `A[i] < stack.peek()`, then add the new height.
- Count the **number of times we push new heights** as blocks.

2️⃣ **Avoid unnecessary blocks**

- Only **push** a height **if it's different** from the last pushed one.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #8**

Let's move to a **more advanced challenge** that involves **greedy algorithms and arrays**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Max Non-Overlapping Segments (Greedy Algorithm)**

You are given **two arrays A and B of N integers**, representing **N segments on a number line**:

- Each segment **starts at A[i]** and **ends at B[i]**.
- Segments may **overlap**.

✅ **Find the maximum number of non-overlapping segments you can select**.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input:
A = [1, 3, 7, 9, 9]
B = [5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
Output: 3
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
The optimal way to select **3 non-overlapping segments** is:

1. Pick segment **(1,5)**
2. Pick segment **(7,8)**
3. Pick segment **(9,10)**

✔ **Total non-overlapping segments = `3`** ✅

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int maxNonOverlappingSegments(int[] A, int[] B)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `0 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ B[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000`  
✅ **O(N) or O(N log N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Sort the segments by their ending point (`B[i]`)**

- Always pick the segment that **ends earliest** (Greedy choice).
- Skip all segments that overlap with the chosen one.

2️⃣ **Use a greedy approach with a simple loop**

- Start with **B[0] as the first picked segment**.
- Keep adding the next **non-overlapping** segment.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #9**

Let's step up the difficulty with **binary search and prefix sums**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Min Max Division (Binary Search + Greedy)**

You are given **an array A of N integers** and **two integers K and M**:

- **K** represents the **maximum number of blocks** you can split A into.
- **M** is the **maximum element value in A**.
- You must **divide A into K blocks** such that the **largest sum among all blocks is minimized**.

✅ **Return the minimal possible largest sum of a block.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: K = 3, A = [2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 6
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
We can split A into **3 blocks**:

1. `[2, 1, 5]` → sum `= 8`
2. `[1, 2]` → sum `= 3`
3. `[2, 2]` → sum `= 4`

The **largest sum among blocks is `6`**, which is the minimal possible.

✔ **Return `6`.** ✅

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int minMaxDivision(int K, int M, int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ M`  
✅ **O(N log sum(A)) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Binary search on the possible range of block sums**

- The **minimum possible sum** is the **max element in A** (a block of 1 element).
- The **maximum possible sum** is the **sum of A** (only 1 block).
- Use **binary search** to find the **smallest valid block sum**.

2️⃣ **Use a greedy function to check if a sum is valid**

- Try to split A into **K blocks**.
- If more than **K blocks** are needed, increase the sum limit.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #10**

Let's take on a **dynamic programming** problem that requires **subarray calculations**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Max Profit (Kadane’s Algorithm)**

You are given **an array A of N integers**, representing **daily stock prices**.

✅ **Find the maximum possible profit you can achieve by buying and selling once.**

- You **must buy before selling**.
- If **no profit is possible**, return `0`.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [23171, 21011, 21123, 21366, 21013, 21367]
Output: 356
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- Buy at `A[1] = 21011`
- Sell at `A[5] = 21367`
- **Profit = `21367 - 21011 = 356`** ✅

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int maxProfit(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `0 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Use a Greedy approach with one pass (Kadane’s Algorithm for min tracking).**

- Keep track of **minimum price seen so far**.
- At each step, calculate potential **profit** if sold today.
- Update the **maximum profit** seen so far.
