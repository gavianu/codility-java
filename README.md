# **🔹 Lesson 01**

### **Codility Training - Challenge #1**

---

### **Problem: Find the Missing Element**

You are given an **array A** consisting of **N different integers** ranging from **1** to **N+1**. This means that exactly **one number is missing** from the sequence. Your task is to find the missing number.

#### **Example**

```java
Input: A = [2, 3, 1, 5]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** The numbers from 1 to 5 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The missing number is **4**.

---

### **Function Signature**

```java
public int findMissingNumber(int[] A)
```

---

### **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq N \leq 100,000 \)
- \( 1 \leq A[i] \leq N+1 \) (each number appears once)

---

### **Requirements**

✅ **Time Complexity:** **O(N)**  
✅ **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (constant extra space)

---

### **Hint**

You can solve this problem efficiently using **Mathematical Sum Formula**:

\[
\text{Sum of first } N+1 \text{ numbers} = \frac{(N+1) \times (N+2)}{2}
\]

Then, compute the sum of elements in **A** and subtract it from the expected sum.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #2**

Let's move to a slightly more **complex problem** that involves **arrays and counting**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Find the Odd Occurrence**

You are given an **array A of N integers**. Every element appears an **even number of times**, except for **one element**, which appears **an odd number of times**.

✅ **Find the element that occurs an odd number of times.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]
Output: 7
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- `9` appears **4 times** (even count).
- `3` appears **2 times** (even count).
- `7` appears **1 time** (**odd count** ✅).
- **Return** `7` (the only number with an odd occurrence).

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int findOddOccurrence(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000` (up to 1 million elements)  
✅ Each number appears **even times, except one**  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (⚡ Efficient Solution Needed)  
✅ **O(1) extra space preferred** (No hash maps!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Can you solve it using a XOR operation?**  
2️⃣ XOR cancels out **even occurrences**:

```
A ⊕ A = 0
```

3️⃣ The remaining value will be the **odd occurrence number**.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #3**

Let's move on to a **slightly harder problem** that involves **prefix sums** and **array traversal**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Equilibrium Index**

You are given an **array A** consisting of **N integers**. An index **P** is called an **equilibrium index** if:

\[
\text{Sum of elements before P} = \text{Sum of elements after P}
\]

✅ **Find any one equilibrium index P or return -1 if none exists.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
At index `3` (`A[3] = 2`), we have:

- **Left sum** = `(-7 + 1 + 5) = -1`
- **Right sum** = `(-4 + 3 + 0) = -1`
- Since **left sum = right sum**, return `3`.

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int findEquilibriumIndex(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)  
✅ **Any valid index is acceptable** (If multiple, return **any one**).

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ Use **prefix sum** to efficiently compute left and right sums.  
2️⃣ **Total sum = Left sum + A[P] + Right sum**  
3️⃣ If `Left sum == Total sum - Left sum - A[P]`, then `P` is an equilibrium index.

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #4**

Let's move on to a **more complex problem** involving **sorting and greedy algorithms**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Max Product of Three**

You are given an **array A** of **N integers**. Your task is to **find the highest possible product** of any **three numbers** from the array.

✅ **Return the maximum possible product of any three numbers.**

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: A = [-10, -10, 5, 2]
Output: 500
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- The highest product is `(-10 * -10 * 5) = 500`, not `(5 * 2 * -10) = -100`.

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int maxProductOfThree(int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `3 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `-1,000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000`  
✅ **O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N³) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Sorting helps!** After sorting, the largest product will be:

- Either **Top 3 biggest numbers**:  
  \[
  A[N-1] \times A[N-2] \times A[N-3]
  \]
- Or **Two smallest negative numbers + biggest positive number**:  
  \[
  A[0] \times A[1] \times A[N-1]
  \]

2️⃣ **Compare both possibilities and return the maximum product.**

---

### **Codility Training - Challenge #5**

Let's move to a **different type of problem** involving **greedy algorithms and counting**.

---

## **🔹 Problem: Tie-Rope Segments (Greedy Algorithm)**

You are given **an integer K** and an **array A** of **N integers**, representing **rope lengths**.

✅ **You need to count how many ropes of at least length `K` can be formed** by tying together adjacent ropes.

---

### **📌 Example**

```java
Input: K = 4, A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3]
Output: 3
```

💡 **Explanation:**  
We can form **3 ropes** that are at least length **4**:

1. Tie `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (Valid ✅)
2. Use `4` alone (Valid ✅)
3. Tie `1 + 1 + 3 = 5` (Valid ✅)

---

## **🔹 Function Signature**

```java
public int countRopes(int K, int[] A)
```

---

## **🔹 Constraints**

✅ `1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000`  
✅ `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000`  
✅ **O(N) time complexity required** (Brute force O(N²) is too slow!)

---

## **🔹 Hints**

1️⃣ **Use a greedy approach:**

- Keep summing adjacent rope lengths.
- If the sum reaches `K` or more, count it as a valid rope and start over.  
  2️⃣ **Only traverse the array once** (O(N) solution required).
